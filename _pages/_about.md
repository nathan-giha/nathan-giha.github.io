Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan](https://ners.engin.umich.edu) where I study nuclear fission and develop instruments for fission experiments. Fission is an incredibly rich subject; there's a lot going on and things get messy. That it was discovered in 1938 and still is not well understood speaks to this fact. Right now, I'm investigating the dependence of prompt fission gamma-rays (PFGs) on incident neutron energy in 239Pu(n,f) to try to experimentally discern the relationship between the angular momenta and excitation energies of fission fragments.

I went to the University of Michigan for undergrad as well, earning my B.S.E. in Nuclear Engineering & Radiological Sciences in 2019. My research career began in the summer of 2016 when I designed readout electronics for a handheld neutron and gamma-ray imaging system for nuclear safeguards. I continued with this project all throughout undergrad, developing better electronics and eventually building, simulating, and performing experiments with my own little imaging system. The unexpected downtime that COVID brought in March of 2020 gave me some time to reflect on my goals, and I turned my gaze toward physics.

Outside of science, I like to cook, **eat**, lift weights, watch Tarantino movies, and play my electric guitar. I'm also a big UM sports fan. Go Blue!

My day-to-day is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; thank you taxpayers for making this wonderful career a possibility for me.
