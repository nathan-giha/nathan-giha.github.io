Hi there! I'm a Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan](https://ners.engin.umich.edu) interested in the physics of nuclear fission, instrumentation, and machine learning for analyzing experimental data. Nuclear fission is an incredibly rich subject; there's a lot going on and things get messy. That it was discovered in 1938 and still is not well understood speaks to this fact. The bright side is, there are so many avenues for study that I can learn almost whatever I want and apply it to my project. Right now, I'm investigating the dependence of prompt fission gamma-rays (PFGs) on incident neutron energy in <sup>239</sup>Pu(_n,f_) to try to experimentally discern the relationship between the angular momenta and excitation energies of fission fragments.

I went to the University of Michigan for undergrad as well, earning my B.S.E. in Nuclear Engineering & Radiological Sciences in 2019. My research career began in the summer of 2016 when I designed readout electronics for a handheld neutron and gamma-ray imaging system for nuclear safeguards. I continued with this project all throughout undergrad, developing better electronics and eventually building, simulating, and performing experiments with my own little imaging system. I did similar work during the first year or so of my Ph.D, then the unexpected downtime that COVID brought in March of 2020 gave me some time to reflect on my goals. I ultimately turned my gaze toward physics and started picking up some books.

Outside of science, I like to snowboard, climb, lift weights, cook, and play my electric guitar. I'm also a big UM sports fan. Go Blue!
