I'm a graduate student at the University of Michigan interested in nuclear fission, instrumentation, and machine learning. I am pursuing a PhD in Nuclear Engineering & Radiological Sciences, funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. You can find my full CV [here](https://nathangiha.info/cv/) or view a short summary below.

I went to the University of Michigan for undergrad as well, earning my B.S.E. in Nuclear Engineering & Radiological Sciences in 2019. My research career began in the summer of 2016 when I designed readout electronics for a handheld neutron and gamma-ray imaging system for nuclear safeguards. I continued with this project all throughout undergrad, developing better electronics and eventually building, simulating, and performing experiments with my own little imaging system. I did similar work during the first year or so of my Ph.D, then the unexpected downtime that COVID brought in March of 2020 gave me some time to reflect on my goals. I ultimately turned my gaze toward physics and started picking up some books.

Outside of science, I like to snowboard, climb, lift weights, cook, and play my electric guitar. I'm also a big UM sports fan. Go Blue!
