I'm a graduate student at the University of Michigan interested in nuclear fission, instrumentation, and machine learning. I am pursuing a PhD in Nuclear Engineering & Radiological Sciences, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. You can find my full CV [here](https://nathangiha.info/cv/) or view a short summary at the bottom of this page.

I began my journey in research in 2016. I joined a lab at UM and designed readout electronics for silicon photomultiplier arrays, to be used in compact radiation imaging systems for nuclear safeguards. I ultimately stayed in the same group to pursue my PhD in 2019, months before COVID shut down our laboratory and all research was put on hold. After reconsidering my goals during this down time (and finishing a course on quantum mechanics that I chose on a whim), I turned my gaze toward physics and started picking up some books. My path toward physics is nontraditional and has been difficult at times, but rewarding.


> If every individual student follows the same current fashion in expressing and thinking about electrodynamics or field theory, then the variety of hypotheses being generated to understand strong interactions, say, is limited. Perhaps rightly so, for possibly the chance is high that the truth lies in the fashionable direction. But, on the off-chance that it is in another direction—a direction obvious from an unfashionable view of field theory—who will find it? - Richard Feynman
