Nuclear fission is an incredibly rich subject; there's a lot going on and things get messy. That it was discovered in 1938 and still is not well understood speaks to this fact. The bright side is, there are so many avenues for study that I can learn almost whatever I want and apply it to my project. Right now, I'm investigating the dependence of prompt fission gamma-rays (PFGs) on incident neutron energy in <sup>239</sup>Pu(_n,f_) to try to experimentally discern the relationship between the angular momenta and excitation energies of fission fragments.
