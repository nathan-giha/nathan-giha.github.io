My graduate research consists of performing and analyzing experiments for understanding nuclear fission. Fission is an incredibly rich subject; there's a lot going on and things get messy. That it was discovered in 1938 and still is not well understood speaks to this fact. Right now, I'm investigating the dependence of prompt fission gamma-rays (PFGs) on incident neutron energy in <sup>239</sup>Pu(**n**,f) to try to experimentally discern the relationship between the angular momenta and excitation energies of fission fragments. Hopefully, this will help solve one of the biggest open questions in fission physics today: What is the angular momentum generation mechanism? If we can answer this question, it will help us understand the **r**-process of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, build better nuclear proliferation detectors, and support the development of advanced power reactors.   

On the side, I try to fill in the gaps left by my lack of formal physics education: a few graduate courses here and there and working through textbooks. I've also been cultivating a budding interest in dark matter detection, doing plenty of reading and honing relevant skills where I'm able.
