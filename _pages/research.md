My graduate research consists of performing and analyzing experiments for understanding nuclear fission. Fission is an incredibly rich subject; that it was discovered in 1938 and still is not well understood speaks to this fact. My goal is to help solve one of the biggest open questions in fission physics today: What is the mechanism of angular momentum generation? If we can answer this question, it will help us understand the *r*-process of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, build better instruments for nuclear nonproliferation, and support the development of advanced power reactors.   

My current focus is on correlated measurements of [fragment properties](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2023.168027) and the discrete prompt fission γ rays. Preparations for such an experiment are underway at Argonne National Laboratory. I previously [investigated](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.107.014612) the dependence of prompt fission γ rays on incident neutron energy in <sup>239</sup>Pu(*n*,*f*) to try to experimentally discern the relationship between the angular momenta and excitation energies of fission fragments.

On the side, I am filling the gaps in my formal physics education: a few graduate courses, working through textbooks, and engaging conversations with colleagues. It turns out that bar napkins make excellent whiteboards when none are readily available. I've also been cultivating a budding interest in dark matter detection, doing plenty of reading and honing relevant skills where I'm able.
